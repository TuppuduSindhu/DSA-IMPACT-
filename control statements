-> entry and exit control
-> entry control loops are for and while 
-> exit control loops are do while 
->when u know the range prefer to use for loop and when you dont know the range use while loop 

//for loop
for(int i;i<=n;i++){
  System.out.println(i);
    }

//while
int i = 1;
while (i <= n) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}

//do while 
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= n);
