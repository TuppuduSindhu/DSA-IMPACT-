Before Scanner Class we have "String buffer"
String Buffer:
String buffer will accept only strings and later we have to convert into targeted class
->We can't convert multiple times That's where Scanner class comes in:
->In scanner class we have multiple pre-defined methods
->Just creating an object for the scanner class we can use those pre-defined methods.
->creating objects for scanner class and calling those objects in scanner class.
->Create a class using class Keyword and name name of the class. the starting letter of the class should be capital(optional)
->For all the methods the name of thhe method should be small.
