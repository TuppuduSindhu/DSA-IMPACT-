      String a="asdfghjkl";
      String res=a.substring(0,4);
      String res1=a.substring(5,9);
      System.out.println(res+res1);
      
      System.out.println(a.charAt(0));
      // System.out.println(res1);
  }
}

//substring and charAt() methods  usedm in above code 

//recursions using string 


->assume that we are starting with two strings input and output string ,initially the output is empty ,we have  few steps they are :
1.take the first character from the string and store in a character variable .
2.check the variable with out target character ,if it matches just return output string else append the character to output string  
3.next slice the string by one character 
whenever string is empty we have to stop the recursion 
4.charAt(0) method is used to access the ahracter at particular index  //here 0 is the index value
5.if we want to slice we use substring(0,n) method   //here 0=starting,n=ending
