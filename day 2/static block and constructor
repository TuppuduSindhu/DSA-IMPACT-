//constructors are used to initiate the objects 
//for every cls there will be a default consrtructor
//whenever we create an object constructor will be called automatically 
//constructor having class name and method properties 
//for every cls there will be a default constructor if we create cls constrctor callef first
//same class name but having() is alled constructor 


//example-1  (for constructor) 

public class q2{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Demo d1=new Demo();
    Demo d2=new Demo();
    //for static methods we no need to cl with object we can cl directly with cls name
   
    
  }
}

class Demo{
  static{
    System.out.println("static");   //static block syntax it is called directly 
  }
  Demo(){
    System.out.println("constructor");   //this is called constructor ,same cls name but ()
  }
  
//we created constructor object two times constructor is called 


//example-2 (static block)
//static block will be created with just a static key word
//it will be called automatically ,no need to call with object or cls name 
//static method 
//for sttic method no need to call with object ,we can directly call with class name 
//and here static will act as instance or object 

public class q2{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Demo d1=new Demo();
    Demo d2=new Demo();
    //for static methods we no need to cl with object we can cl directly with cls name
    Demo.name();
    
  }
}

class Demo{
  static{
    System.out.println("static");//static block syntax it is called directly 
  }
  Demo(){
    System.out.println("constructor");//this is called constructor ,same cls name but ()
  }

//static act as instance for a method 
static void name(){
  System.out.println("hello");
}
}
