maximum product of subarray 
 int[] arr={2,3,-6,4};
 1.if the question is asked as product ,start your product variable with 1 
 2.in the subarray if we have even positive numbers  the product will be positive numbers 
 3.in the subarray if we have odd negative numbers the product will be negative numbers. 
 4.in the subarray if we have atleast a zero ,start you product variable with 1 
 5.if we have negative value the product of prefix elements will be positive , and product of suffix elements will be positive 
 6.initialize the maximum variable extreme negative 


  koko eating bananas leetcode 875 :
  steps :
  1.whatever max value we have ,we have to check those many values (loop from 0 to max)-check the elements till max 
  2.initialize left pointer at 0,right pointer at max 
  3.get the middle element  
  4.divide the array elements and get the ceil values 
  5.add all the ceil values and compare with target hours ,if value is less than or equal to target hours -eliminate right half 
  6.change the right pointer to mid-1 and left is at starting only 
  7.if the sum is greater than to the target ,eleminate left half - change left pointer to mid+1 and return left
