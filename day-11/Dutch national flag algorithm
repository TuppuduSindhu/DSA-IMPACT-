-> initialize three pointers l,m at 0th index and h at n-1 index 
-> the elements between m and h  are unsorted so we have to traverse through out the array 
->if array[m]==0 then move to right ,means swap between l ad m , and increase l and m . 
  -> if array[m]==1 just stay there only ,just increase m .
  ->else swap arr[m] and arr[h] and decrease h
