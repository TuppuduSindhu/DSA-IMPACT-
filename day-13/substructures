arrays=[1,2,3] 

subarray=> sub arrays are the part of arrays but continuous ,order.
->reverse order not acceptable 
-> subarray of given array is [1,2],[2,3] 
-> not possible subarrays are [2,3],[3,2]

subset=> subsets also same part of the arrays ,may or maynot be continuos and not in reverse order 
=>[1,2] ,[1,3],[2,3] are possible subsets 
=>[2,1] are not the subset because it is in reverse order.


string=a,b,c 
=>subsequence = subsequence is the part of the string may or may not be continuos 
=>ab , bc, ac are sunsequence but not ca 


=> substring =substrings are the part of the strings which must follow sequence 
=> ab,bc, are the substrings 
=>ac,ca are not the substrings bcz they are not continuos.
