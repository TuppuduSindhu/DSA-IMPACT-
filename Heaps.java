=>Heap data Structure will store the data in arrays it will be stored by trees and
  ->the values will be arranged by trees with the help of complete binary tree 
  ->with the help of priority queues heaps got created 
  ->Heaps are created with two datastructures they are trees and arrays 
  ->elements can access through index values and arranged in tree structure of trees
  ->Types : 1.bottum to top approach 
            2.top to botttum approach 



  =========================N-Arrays ===========================
  Tries : we have to create a node which can store character array  of 26 alphabets .
  ->the last node need to change the flag to true 
  ->structure : class Node{
  int[26]data 
  boolean flag;
  Node next;
}
Advantage : to get the faster retrivals of the strings
