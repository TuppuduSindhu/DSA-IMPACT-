  Time complexity constraints : 1)ignore smaller  values 
                                2)focus on worst case 
                                3)ignore constants 
    to solve a problem we have 3 steps 
    in step 1 : write some lines and it contains 2 for loops to get step 2
    and in step 2 we run one more for loop to get step 3 
    and in step 3 we write the code in constant time 
    if we analize the code the timecomplexity will be n**2 for step 1 and n for step2 and 1(constant) for step3
    to get the time complexity for the code we follow time complexity contraints like ignore small values,constants and final time complexity will be n**2 .

    Best canse ,Average Case and Worst Case  

    Best Case : getiing output in less time complexity 
    Worst Case : getting output in more Time complexity [O(f)]
    Average Case: average of best and worst 
    
  Space complexity : if we use any extra space for solving the problem that extra space is consider as space complexity
